# Retail reorder prediction using Serverless Spark through Google Cloud Shell

## 1. Overview

With the advent of cloud environments, the concept of huge capital investments in infrastructure in terms of capital and maintenance is a thing of the past. Even when it comes to provisioning infrastructure on cloud services, it can get tedious and cumbersome.

In this example, you will look at executing a simple PySpark code which runs on Serverless batch (a fully managed Dataproc cluster). It is similar to executing code on a Dataproc cluster without the need to initialize, deploy or manage the underlying infrastructure.

In this use case, we will be building a predictive model capable of using customer orders collected over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order.
